Hello everyone, i created both 1disk and 2disk. I decided to now discontinue/closing 2disk.
It would be hard for me to create 2 accounts for 1disk and 2disk
it may even affect my mental health since i have to do all of this work by myself.
And no, im NOT discontinuing 1disk because of this.
I just have difficulties managing 1disk and 2disk alone.
Instead, i will be making changes, 1disk will be not just an upcoming game, software, music, film, animation studio industry.
But also an upcoming game, video, music & art label! Yes you heard me right, 1disk is also gonna be a game, video, music & art label
Before you say anything were not copying Quataun which is also an game, video, music & art label. We don't wanna compete with them and get trouble
So we wanna stay out of it, Quataun is really popular while 1disk is just small.
Who knows, we might compete with them if 1disk became huge (somehow)
But we would not copy them of what they do, that would be dumb and stupid for me to do that.
Its also not doing so well, we got some followers (only 1disk lol) and many people would say to no give or something like that
but you don't understand of how managing 2disk can be frustating to me, the owner
and now it was all a waste. 
I don't really talk about my life but i got caught up with alot of exams and i wouldn't be managing 1disk and 2disk
so thats also one of the reason why im giving up on 2disk

Thats basically it, i hope you understand my problem and probably forgive me lol.
Thanks and love yall <3
